Gamma correction is the process of adjusting the brightness of an image so colors appear correctly on-screen
Gamma correction is a technique used to display colors on your screen accurately. It adjusts for a device’s non-linear display characteristics, ensuring the encoded and decoded luminance in digital images and videos is accurate. It’s performed by the camera and monitor, which have an internal function that adjusts brightness to create more realistic images.
